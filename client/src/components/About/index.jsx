            <h2>Why I made Ensemble</h2>
            <p>
            I created Ensemble out of a deep-seated love for music and a passion for discovering new songs and artists. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Music, to me, is more than just soundâ€”it's a journey, a universal language that transcends borders and connects people. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Ensemble is a testament to this belief, a tool to help music lovers venture into the vast, vibrant world of music beyond what's familiar and mainstream.
            </p>
            <p>This started as a tool that was inspired by my friends. Ensemble is a tribute to those who have shared music, and the experience of discovering something new, with me. </p>
